# AirBnB clone - Project

# Description of the project:
This marks the initial phase of the AirBnB clone project,
focusing on the backend development.
We integrated it with a console application,
leveraging the Python cmd module for streamlined interaction.

# Description of the command interpreter:
The application's interface resembles the Bash shell,
with a limited number of commands designed specifically for use with the AirBnB website.
the folowing actions can be performed:
* Instantiate a new object (e.g., create a new User or a new Place instance).
* Fetch an object from a file, a database, etc.
* Perform operations on objects (e.g., count, compute statistics, etc.).
* Modify attributes of an object.
* Delete an object instance
